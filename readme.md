This is actually for my client, where the client want me to get lot of blog posts, html element, images from his old website and upload it into his new website..

The scrape folder is where the scraped file (blog content, images, some html element) stored.. sorry if the code were dirty, because i want to finish it as soon as possble and meet the deadline..
